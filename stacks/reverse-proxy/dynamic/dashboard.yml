# Traefik Dashboard Exposure (Dynamic Config)
# File: stacks/reverse-proxy/dynamic/dashboard.yml
#
# Purpose:
# Exposes the Traefik dashboard through HTTPS using the standard DNS naming scheme.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - Dashboard should NOT be exposed publicly in client deployments unless protected.
# - Always protect with BasicAuth middleware (recommended).
#
# Access URL (example):
# https://proxy.home.ar

http:
  routers:
    traefik-dashboard:
      rule: "Host(`proxy.home.ar`)"
      entryPoints:
        - websecure
      service: api@internal
      tls: {}

  # Optional: BasicAuth protection (recommended)
  #
  # middlewares:
  #   dashboard-auth:
  #     basicAuth:
  #       users:
  #         - "admin:$apr1$H6uskkkW$IgXLP6ewTrSuBkTrqE8wj/"
  #
  # To generate a password hash:
  # htpasswd -nb admin strongpassword
  #
  # Then uncomment middleware and attach it to router:
  # middlewares:
  #   - dashboard-auth
